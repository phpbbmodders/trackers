// DEVELOPERS PLEASE NOTE
//
// All language files should use UTF-8 as their encoding and the files must not contain a BOM.
//
// Placeholders can now contain order information, e.g. instead of
// 'Page %s of %s' you can (and should) write 'Page %1$s of %2$s', this allows
// translators to re-order the output of data while ensuring it remains correct
//
// You do not need this where single placeholders are used, e.g. 'Message %d' is fine
// equally where a string contains only two placeholders which are used to wrap text
// in a url you again do not need to specify an order e.g., 'Click %sHERE%s' is fine
//
// Some characters you may want to copy&paste:
// ’ » “ ” …
//

/**
*	EXTENSION-DEVELOPERS PLEASE NOTE
*
*	You are able to put your permission sets into your extension.
*	The permissions logic should be added via the 'core.permissions' event.
*	You can easily add new permission categories, types and permissions, by
*	simply merging them into the respective arrays.
*	The respective language strings should be added into a language file, that
*	start with 'permissions_', so they are automatically loaded within the ACP.
